Currently here are sources that I use for X11/Xorg-check. Besides the **Termux** environment, sources could also useable in MobaXterm and Debian 9.2. The script **s** could use to update a virgin Termux [APK](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3535#issuecomment-489430202) with needed packages for check.

_touch.c_ should check basics of mutitouch functions (just not valid)
_check.c_ demonstrator of _finger-only_ control (in preparation)
